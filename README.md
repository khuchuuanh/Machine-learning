# Machine-learning
## Introduction
Here is my python source code about implementing machine learning algorithms including supervised learning and unsupervised learning. I also used several kaggle datasets like tranditional datasets and time series datasets to practice with machine learning algorithms. I used to some basic techniques for data science including : Data visualization, data cleaning, data preprocessing, way to choose best parameters as well as best model for data.

#### Real data
I got a real dataset which was very dirty data. I cleaned this data and preprocess after that choosing appropriate machine learning models to predict the career level for each candidate.

#### PCA
I learned and used PCA algorithms to reduce and visualization MNIST dataset.
